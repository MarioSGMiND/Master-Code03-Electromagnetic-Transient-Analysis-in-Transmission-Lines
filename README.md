# Master-Code03-Electromagnetic-Transient-Analysis-in-Transmission-Lines
This repository shows an electromagnetic model for the study of transitory phenomena associated on transmission lines.
The codes presented are part of the Electromagnetic Transients course of the Master's Degree in Engineering taught by PhD. Juan Carlos Escamilla SÃ¡nchez. 
The modeling comes from the Telegraph Equations, and the Pi model of a transmission line to find traveling waves, losses, and transient problems in the same. 
The final code shows the V0 (Initial Voltage) and VL (Final Voltage) in a Transmission Line considering all the criteria mentioned above.
